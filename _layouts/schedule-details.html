<li><p><strong>Lisa Colledge, Senior Manager, Global Strategic Alliances, Elsevier</strong></p>
<p>Dr Lisa Colledge is an expert in the use of research metrics that provide insights into research
performance of universities, researchers, journals, and so on. She developed this knowledge 
“on the job” by working with editors and learned societies to build understanding of journal 
Impact Factors relative to their competitors, and to develop strategies to improve journals’ 
standings. She then joined the Elsevier Research Intelligence product group, which develops 
tools to support performance measurement, and most recently launched SciVal.
</p>
<p>
Lisa currently applies her expertise to Snowball Metrics, for which she is Programme Director;
in this initiative, a group of universities agrees a single robust method to generate metrics 
that are commonly understood, draw on a combination of all data sources available to the 
universities generating them, and which thus support international benchmarking.
</p>
<p>
Prior to joining Elsevier, Lisa conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh.
She holds both a DPhil and an MA from the University of Oxford.

            <p><strong>Mike Thelwall, Professor of Information Science, and Kayvan Kousha, Researcher in webometrics and altmetrics at the Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group, University of Wolverhampton</strong></p>
            <p>
Mike Thelwall leads the Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group at the University of 
Wolverhampton, UK and is a research associate at the Oxford Internet Institute. He
evaluates metrics derived from the web and has developed free software and methods for 
systematically gathering and analysing web and social web data, including for altmetrics, 
webometrics, and sentiment analysis for Mendeley, Twitter, YouTube, Google Books, 
blogs and the general web. He also conducts evaluation exercises for large organisations 
using web data, including for various divisions within the United Nations and European 
Commission. He has published hundreds of refereed journal articles and three books, 
including “Webometrics and social web research methods” (free online).
            </p>
            <p>
Kayvan Kousha is a researcher in webometrics and altmetrics at the Statistical Cybermetrics 
Research Group, University of Wolverhampton, UK. His main research areas include web 
citation extraction and altmetric analysis based on different sources of online impact. His over 
30 refereed publications have investigated a range of methods and sources for the impact 
assessment of research, including digitized books, syllabi, presentations, blogs, academic 
social media tools, videos and online reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
The underlying goal of his research is to identify web sources for supplementary impact 
indictors, especially in subject areas where bibliometric indicators might be insufficient for 
research assessment. He recently co-authored the book chapter “Web Impact Metricsfor 
Research Assessment” for MIT press and has used the developed web impact methods in 
practice for several projects such as for the European Commission and for the United Nations 
University.

		<strong>What’s going on in the communication of research?</strong>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		At the core of altmetrics is the belief that every researcher is a communicator, and that increasingly their conversations are moving online. Our panelists will share and reflect on their own experiences, and discuss what the online landscape offers to them.

		<strong>Altmetrics and publishers</strong>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Many of the larger journal publishers have now incorporated altmetrics data into their platforms and are using the information to shape their marketing campaigns. Speakers in this session will present on the steps that their organisations have taken, and what they see as the most useful applications for the data.

            advocate of open research practice and improved data management. He currently works as 
            Advocacy Director at the Public Library of Science. Along with his work in structural biology 
            and biophysics his research and writing focuses on the interface of web technology with 
            science and the successful (and unsuccessful) application of generic and specially designed 
            tools in the academic research environment.</p>

		<strong>Outside the article: tracking other research outputs</strong>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Scholarly work comes in many forms beyond the published article, and no one has yet come up with a conclusive way of monitoring and capturing the attention that those other outputs receive. Our panelists will present their approach to better supporting these aspects of the research process.

		<strong>NISO - update on standards</strong>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In 2013 the US National Information Standards Organisation (NISO) launched an Alternative Metrics Initiative with the goal of exploring, identifying and advancing the standards of these new metrics and their role within the research evaluation process. Following the release of a white paper earlier this year, NISO Executive Director Todd Carpenter gives an update on progress so far.
