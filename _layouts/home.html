        Announcing the 2<sup>nd</sup> Altmetrics Conference: Amsterdam<br>
      </h2>
      <p>
        To follow the successful first annual altmetrics conference, 1:AM (London), 2:AM will be held in Amsterdam on October 7-8th 2015.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us at this yearâ€™s meeting to continue discussions on all things altmetrics, where we'll build on the themes and ideas of last year. To help us bring the final program together we'd love to know which topics are of most interest to you - please do take a few minutes to give us your thoughts in <a href="http://survey.euro.confirmit.com/wix2/p1843493082.aspx">this short survey</a>.</p>

      <p>There'll be lots happening, including a hack day ahead of the main event. The 2:AM conference will be held in concert with the altmetrics research conference, altmetrics15 (Oct 9) to further collaboration and cross-pollination between research and practice - more details on this will follow soon.

      </p>
      <p><i>
        Stay tuned for further programme details!
