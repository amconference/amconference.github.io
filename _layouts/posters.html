        <h2>Posters and demos</h2>

        <p>
            We’d like to invite anyone interested to bring along a poster for display or laptop to demo their latest developments. Time will be made available for conferences attendees to view and ask questions about these during the Tuesday lunch break.</p>

<p>We’ll provide tape/pins to hang them up with. Any equipment needed for demos (laptops etc) should be provided by you.</p>

<p>If you like to bring a poster or demo something, please give us a few details below by the 30th of September so we can make sure we allocate space accordingly.</p>
