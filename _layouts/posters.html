<h2>Posters</h2>

<p>
We've invited anyone who wishes to share their experience in the altmetrics or research communication space to bring along a poster showcasing their experience. This is intended to be very informal; the idea is to get people talking and sharing ideas.
</p>

<p>
Topics suggested included&hellip;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running a workshop to encourage your faculty to share their research online</li>
  <li>Working with the communications office to highlight a particular piece of work</li>
  <li>Including altmetrics data in your marketing campaigns</li>
</ul>

<p>
Posters will be displayed in the refreshment area for viewing during breaks and the drinks reception, with a Â£100 prize offered for the best one! We're also hoping to make them available online on this page after the event.
